# Beat Buddy
Beat Buddy is a tool to help find beats per minute (BPM). This app is very simple and I do not intend to expand upon it at this time.

## Description
I've enabled Mac deployment for this app through Project Catalyst and included app icons for all supported platforms. As of writing this, landscape is enabled but I will disable that setting in the next commit.

The "Beat Buddy" name is inspired by the character in the middle of the screen that dances along as you tap to the beat to find the BPM of your song.

This is Beat Buddy.

As previously stated, I do not intend to continue development on this project. This is just a silly project that I wanted to create but it may serve some use, both for learning and for using. I may add an ipa file and app file to the releases section in the future.
